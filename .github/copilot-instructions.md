## Repository Context

- **Repository:** mobile
- **Purpose:** Flutter mobile app for restaurant owners to manage their business
- **Tech Stack:** Flutter 3.x, Dart 3.x, Riverpod 2.4, Dio, Hive, Firebase
- **Status:** 🟡 Planned for Sprint 1 (after Sprint 0.5 Menu Demo)
- **Spec Version:** v1.1-specs

## 🚀 "Continue Work" Trigger

When the user says **"continue work"**, **"tiếp tục"**, or **"next task"**:

### Step 1: Read Local Progress

Read `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md` in this repository to understand:

- Current sprint and focus
- Which stories are assigned to this repo
- Current status of each story (🔴 Not Started / 🟡 In Progress / ✅ Done)
- Any blockers or notes from previous session

### Step 2: Identify Next Task

From CURRENT_WORK.md:

1. If any story is 🟡 In Progress → continue that story
2. Otherwise, pick the first 🔴 Not Started story
3. If all stories are ✅ Done → report completion and suggest next sprint

### Step 3: Load Specifications

1. Check the "Spec References" section in CURRENT_WORK.md for the spec link
2. Fetch and read the relevant specification section
3. Primary spec: `flutter-mobile-app-spec.md` (entire file)

### Step 4: Implement

1. Follow the spec exactly
2. Apply code standards from this file (see below)
3. Clean Architecture, Riverpod state management

### Step 5: Update Progress

After implementation, **update `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md`**:

- Change story status from 🔴 to 🟡 (in progress) or ✅ (done)
- Add notes about what was implemented
- Add any blockers or follow-up items
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp

### Step 6: Git Workflow

1. Create/use feature branch: `feat/<story-description>`
2. Commit with conventional message
3. Run `flutter analyze && flutter test`
4. Create PR when story is complete

### Step 7: Post Event to Slack

After completing a story, post an event to `#agent-events` (channel ID: `C0A1VSFQ9SS`):

```
📱 STORY_DONE from mobile: [Story Title]
---
Details: [What screens/features were implemented]
Affected: [api, specs]
Action: [Any API needs or spec updates required]
Spec: [Link to relevant spec section]
```

Use `slack_post_message` with channel_id `C0A1VSFQ9SS`.

### Step 8: Report

Tell the user:

- What story you worked on
- What was implemented
- Current status
- What's next
- Event posted to Slack

---

## 🔄 "Sync Events" Trigger

When the user says **"sync events"**, **"check events"**, or **"đồng bộ"**:

1. **Read recent messages** from `#agent-events` (channel ID: `C0A1VSFQ9SS`) using `slack_get_channel_history`
2. **Filter for events affecting this repo** (look for "mobile" in Affected field)
3. **Report relevant events** to user with recommended actions
4. **If API_READY from api** → integrate new endpoints
5. **If SCHEMA_UPDATED from contracts** → update Dart models to match

## Code Standards

### Clean Architecture

- **Presentation:** Widgets, pages, state (Riverpod)
- **Domain:** Entities, use cases, repository interfaces
- **Data:** Repository implementations, data sources, DTOs

### Riverpod Patterns

- Use `@riverpod` annotation with code generation
- `AsyncValue` for loading/error/data states
- Family providers for parameterized data

### Vietnamese Localization

- Default locale: vi-VN
- Currency: VND with format 75.000₫
- All user-facing text in Vietnamese

## Git Workflow

**CRITICAL:** Follow `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`:

- Never commit directly to main branch
- Branch naming: `feat/<story-description>` (e.g., `feat/dashboard-home`)
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create PR after commits

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** `api` repo for REST/GraphQL endpoints
- **Uses:** `contracts` repo types as reference (not direct import in Dart)
- **Firebase:** For push notifications
